        <h1>Resume</h1>
        <p>On this section I will resume all the lesson about Working with text in html.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>There are 6 types of headings beginning with &#60h1&#62 to &#60h6&#62</p>
        <p>The h1 is the most important and biggest.</p>

        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>In order to work with paragraphs we should use &#60p&#62</p>

        <h2>Bold text</h2>
        <p>Working with bold text is important for screen readers because on case of bold text the screen reader will add <strong>importance</strong> to the text but only if we use &#60strong&#62 element.</p>
        <strong>The strong element looks like this</strong>

        <p>We can also use &#60b&#62 element <strong>but the screen reader will not read this element with importance</strong> so we have to be carefull with that</p>

        <b>The b element looks like this</b>

        <h2>Italic text</h2>
        <p>The italic text have emphasis but only if we use &#60em&#62 <em>element, it's similar as the strong and b element</em></p>
        <em>The italic text looks like this</em>

        <p>On the other hand, there exist a &#60i&#62 element that make the text italic but does not give emphasis to the text for the screen reader</p>

        <h2>Comments on HTML</h2>
        <p>On html we can make comments that will not appear on the web page but it can be a useful tool to remember and know why we have done something in the future. we can make a comment by writing &#60!--content of the comment--&#62</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We have learned that exist elements for headings, paragraphs, bold text and italic text, and while learning this we saw the nesting and identation that make us clear which elements are the parent and childs, or sibilings.</p>
        <p>By this point, we know that we can combine all the elements and this is more common so I have already make use of it on all this resume.</p>
